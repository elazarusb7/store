This module provides various GPO related functionality. It will ultimately contain all the code for automatic interaction with GPO. But as of this writing it provides two semi-manual processes.

1. It generates an XML file per GPO's specifications of pending orders for consumption by their system. There is a file for each day. There is a form for doing this manually and also an automated process triggered by CRON and runs in the morning hours that always generates a file for the previous day. There is a view that lists these files for download. Any orders that are processed into an XML file are set to a status of "process" or "pick_slip_generated", both are the same.
2. It provides a form that consumes and processes a CSV file of GPO order numbers that have been fulfilled. (it can also accommodate JSON and XML if necessary). When processed it sets all matching Drupal Commerce orders to a status of "complete"

**NOTE: The files with the .autoversion extension do not do special handling for 988. They are intended to be reverted to when we start automating this process with CRON. Easier to save them here like this then dig out and bring up to date some very old branch when the time comes.**
