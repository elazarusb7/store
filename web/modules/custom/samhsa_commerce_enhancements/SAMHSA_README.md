# SAMHSA Commerce Enhancements

This module was built post JBS (October 2022) and may contain some overlapping functionality.

Initially, this module will contain custom fields and additions to the Commerce order forms. UPDATE: I was not able to add field configuration to this module due to circular dependencies. So the fields that this module relies on will be stored in the site config dir. These fields are labeled with 'special_request'.

Place custom plugins, theming hooks and other bits of code that don't belong in their own module here.
